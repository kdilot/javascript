        /*
        Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
        If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...
        Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]
        Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

        // My solution
        function friend(friends) {
            let arr = [];
            friends.forEach(element => element.length == 4 ? arr.push(element) : '');
            return arr;
        }

        // Good solution(using array.filter)
        function friend(friends) {
            return friends.filter(n => n.length === 4)
