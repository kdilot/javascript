        System A: buy a ticket(15 dollars) every time
        System B: buy a card(500 dollars) and every time
        buy a ticket the price of which is 0.90 times the price he paid for the previous one.

        System A: 15 * 3 = 45
        System B: 500 + 15 * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90) * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90 * 0.90) * 0.90( = 536.5849999999999, no rounding for each ticket)
        
        movie(500, 15, 0.9) should return 43
